<p align="center">Hi, I'm Alice (or Ali<b>SA</b> according to the russian bueroucracy) and right now I am studying Digital Humanities at the university of Bologna📚<p>

### About Me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🎓 I have a bachelor in Iternational Relations and a master in International Cooperation on Human Rights and Intercultural Heritage.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💻 Last year I decided to enroll to another master program in [Digital Humanities](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge) .  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🎴 I am passionate about modern technology, gamedesign and history, so I am trying to figure out how to intertwine them!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🎮 I have studied gamedesign and academic art during the pandemic and can draw a decent oil painting or write an intricate quest.
